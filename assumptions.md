# Assumptions

## Project Scope Assumptions

1. The primary goal of this project is to visualize cryptocurrency trading values in different currencies using a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React.
2. The application will fetch real-time data from the CoinGecko API to display current trading values and historical data for cryptocurrencies.

## Technical Assumptions

1. React is chosen for its component-based architecture, virtual DOM efficiency, and robust ecosystem suitable for building SPAs.
2. Material-UI is selected for UI components and styling due to its pre-built components and theming capabilities, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing design.
3. ECharts is integrated for data visualization, providing interactive charts like line charts to display cryptocurrency trading values over time.
4. React Router is used for client-side routing to enable seamless navigation between different views within the SPA.
5. Axios is utilized for handling HTTP requests to interact with the CoinGecko API, facilitating data retrieval and updating in real-time.
6. Context API is employed for state management across components, reducing prop drilling and ensuring efficient data flow within the application.

## User Experience Assumptions

1. Users are familiar with basic web navigation principles and interactions such as clicking, scrolling, and searching within a web application.
2. The application assumes users have a general understanding of cryptocurrencies and their market data, although detailed financial knowledge is not required to use the application.
